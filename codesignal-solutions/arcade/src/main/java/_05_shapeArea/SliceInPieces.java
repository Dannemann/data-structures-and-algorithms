	 * below. Notice how each piece is made of "<code>(n * 2 - 1)</code>" squares,
	 * and we need "<code>(n - 1)</code>" pieces to fill most of the polygon. To
	 * finish it, we need one more piece of size "<code>n</code>" (the pink one). To
	 * make it easier, try to visualize the polygon as a square and not as a
	 * diamond.
