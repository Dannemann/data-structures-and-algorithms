	/**
	 * <p>
	 * <b>To visualize this solution:</b> Imagine that you are creating the polygon
	 * by the borders. Each iteration is a border and the "<code>+ 1</code>" at the
	 * end is the central square. The constant "<code>4</code>" is the number you
	 * need to multiply to get the correct number of squares to fill a border. It is
	 * "<code>4</code>" because you need 4 squares to make the very first border
	 * around the central square, making all borders products of 4. Therefore, the
	 * borders will be of sizes 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and so on. You can visualize it
	 * in the image below. Each color represents a border (purple, green, yellow and
	 * blue) around the central square (red).
